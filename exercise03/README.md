# Exercise 03

## Learning Goals

1. Working with an editor to create your first python script
2. Run tests locally
3. Commit and push changes from your local computer to your repository
4. Fix a series of tests that focus on
	- strings
	- None

## Getting Started

1. Using our `github workflow` be sure to `git pull --rebase upstream master` to get your clone in sync
2. Modify the files and `commit` changes to complete your solution
3. Push/sync the changes to your origin on GitHub
4. Create a pull request from your origin to upstream


## Completing the Assignment

In this exercise you will flesh out the logic in [exercise03.py](exercise03.py) to ensure that all tests in [test_exercise03.py](test_exercise03.py) pass.

If you run into trouble getting tests to pass, post a pull request with failing tests so that we can collaborate on a solution. You can always update an open PR by making another commit. Please mark you PR's that are asking for help with the label 'Help' on github.
